Server Requirements
-------------------

-  Web server, with PHP installed.  
-  PHP is available for free at: www.php.net.


Setup
-----

1. Open the file status.php in a text editor.

2. Edit the two lines pointing to the live and dead images to reflect your server.
   If you wish to use a different live or dead image, indicate its path instead.
   
3. Upload all files to your web server.

4. Access the page: www.yourserver.com/test.html
   This should display the status of several test websites.
   
5. You can now create your own status checking page using test.html as a guide.
   See instructions below for details.
   

How does the script work ?
--------------------------

The script is simple to implement.  Create a simple <img> tag that calls the status script
as the source (src) and passes the url in the string. The image tag should look like the 
one below.

<img src="status.php?link=www.redhat.com" width="37" height="20">

To check different servers, simply change the url to the url of the desired server.  A 
common mistake is to leave of the "status.php?link=" portion of the source.  This will cause
the script to not work properly.

To check servers on a port other than 80, simply include the port in the url.  Your image tag should look like the 
one below. It is not necessary to indicate the default port of 80.

<img src="status.php?link=www.redhat.com:21" width="37" height="20">
